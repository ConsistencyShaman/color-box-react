# What is this?

This is one of my first React apps I wrote to basically just fetch data from a local json server and display it on the screen. You can write any of the 140 colours that are on the data base, the app will show you their RGB and HEX value plus the colour it self 

## Firts things firts

```
npm i
```

## json Server

do: 
```
npx json-server -p 3500 -w data/dbrgb.json
```

This will start the server where you can them fetch the data from colors and get the functionality of the app working

Nothing else needed. 
npm start 
and try it out in your browser
